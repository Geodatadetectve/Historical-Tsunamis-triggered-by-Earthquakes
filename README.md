# Historical-Tsunamis-triggered-by-Earthquakes
Objective: To assess Tsunamis that were historically triggered by earthquakes. 

Skills used
Data mining, aggregation, Data manipulation and cleaning, Desktop design, Data visualization and Data insights, DAX, Pivot Tables

Main Process
✅ I reviewed the data to find any bad data points, missing data, and duplicated data to perform accurate analysis, visualize the data, and draw actionable insights.  
✅ After that, I performed data cleaning and transformation procedures. Specifically, I converted the date format to YYYY.MM.DD, and changed fields like Eq-Magnitude, depth, and Ts_intensity to numeric data types. I removed all blank and null data, and got rid of any duplicate data.
✅ The final data schema- File type (xlsx), #No of data (132), #of columns (14).
✅Performed simple Pivot tables
✅ Final step was to divide into the cleaned data and obtain important insights.

Tools
Excel spreadsheet, Power Query, Microsoft PowerBI

Insights from the data
✅The range of earthquakes recorded in various regions spans from 1 to 7. NORTHERN CHILE experienced the most earthquakes at 7, trailed by CENTRAL PERU and SEIKAIDO. NORTHERN CHILE contributed to 5.34% of the earthquakes analyzed.
✅Out of all the earthquakes, 104 of them were associated with tsunamis, accounting for 79.39% of the total. This was followed by probable tsunamis, questionable tsunamis, and very doubtful tsunamis.
✅The causes of tsunamis were earthquake (115 - 87.79%), landslide (15), and volcano (1).
✅Regarding destruction, tsunamis with severe damages (>$5 to $24 million) accounted for 33.59% of the damages caused by tsunamis.
✅In terms of tsunami-related deaths, the category of few deaths (~1 to 50 people) had the highest count at 67, which was 378.57% more than the lowest count of some deaths (~51 to 100 people), which had 14 deaths.
✅Concerning the total number of houses destroyed by tsunamis, the category with many houses (~101 to 1000 houses) had the highest count at 56, followed by very many houses (~1001 or more houses) at 41.
